# Translation Files for Verbo Vivo UI

This directory contains the translation files for the Verbo Vivo application interface, organized by language code.

## IMPORTANT: Translation Quality

The files for the following languages were initially populated with English text as placeholders or machine-translated:

*   `es/translation.json` (Spanish)
*   `zh/translation.json` (Chinese)
*   `ja/translation.json` (Japanese)

**It is MANDATORY to use professional human translators for these languages.** Special attention should be paid to cultural nuances, particularly for Chinese and Japanese, to ensure the translations are accurate, natural, and contextually appropriate.

The `pt/translation.json` (Portuguese) and `en/translation.json` (English) files should also be reviewed by native speakers for quality assurance.

Please ensure that any new keys added to one file are replicated across all language files and translated accordingly.
